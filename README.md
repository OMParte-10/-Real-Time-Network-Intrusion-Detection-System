# Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This project sets up and configures Snort to monitor and analyze live network traffic in real-time. It includes custom rule creation, deep packet inspection, and simulation of attacks to test detection.

## Features
- Snort configuration for live traffic
- Custom Snort rules
- Attack simulation scripts
- Detection tuning to reduce false positives

## How to Use
1. Install Snort on your system
2. Replace your Snort config with `snort_rules.conf`
3. Run `simulate_attacks.sh` to test detection
